[WARNING]
====
Bonita Central requires direct access to the cluster nodes
====

With a Bonita runtime deployed as a cluster, Bonita Central is connected to the load balancer. It allows to check the health of the cluster, as well as get its configuration. +
For monitoring, Bonita Central requires direct access to the cluster nodes, so that it can get the metrics for each node.
To allow this, if Bonita Central is not on the same network that the nodes, it may be required to add a network route so that the nodes are accessible from Bonita Central.
