= Application declaration 
:description: Application declaration 

In Bonita Central, we refer as application to the entity that will be built and run by Bonita. It is the content of a unique Git repository. 
One Runtime will be able to host several applications that share the same Business Data Model. 

== Prerequisites
. All Runtimes (nodes) linked to an application space should have the same version. 
. To facilitate the data exchange, install Bonita Central in the same network as your Bonita Runtimes
. 


== How to declare an application ? 

After installing Bonita Central, the first thing you will have to do is to add the applications you want to supervise. 
Nothing easier because you will be able to do it directly from the overview page.
